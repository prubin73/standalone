This repository contains a LyX layout for the `standalone` LaTeX class, which is useful for typesetting individual figures.

The layout is available under the GPLv3 open-source license.

The current version is 1.0.

This layout is written for LyX file format 66, the current format for LyX 2.3.1. You may be able to use it with (somewhat) older versions of LyX by manually editing the `Format` line in the module. It should be forward compatible with later versions of LyX.
